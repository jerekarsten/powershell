# Tail-DFGamelog
Powershell script to monitor Dwarf Fortress gamelog

Setup:
  Set your Dwarf Fortress folder path (the one containing gamelog.txt) in settings.json before first run.
  You can run the powershell file anywhere, but the two json-files need to be in the same folder as the powershell-file.
